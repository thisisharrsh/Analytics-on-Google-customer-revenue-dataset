Problem statement :

◻ In every business it was proven about 80-20 rule., this rule tells us 80% of our revenue will be generated by only 20% of our potential customers. So our goal is to predict the revenue that is going to be generated by those potential customers in the near feature. So that marketing teams will invest appropriate money on promotional strategies to attract potential customers.

◻ In simple words we are given with the users past data and transactions (when they logged into Gstore)., so by using this data we need to predict the future revenue will be created by those customers.

◻ So google provided Merchandise customer dataset and no.of transactions per customer. We will build a predictive model using Gstore data set to predict the total revenue per customer that helps in better use of marketing budget and we will also interpret the most impacting element on the total revenue prediction using different models.
